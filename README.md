# CONTENT
2DPlots
scripts to generate plots of 2D basis functions

AdditionalFunctions
contains additional functions, e.g for HB and THB refinement, for the generation of Gauss points and weights and for error analysis.

CurvePlot
algorithms to generate B-Spline curves

NurbsBookAlgorithms
contains algorithms from the NURBS book by Piegl and Tiller for basic evaluation of B-splines and B-spline curves
 
BSplClasses
contains bSplBas class and inherited classes bSplBasFun (one basis function), hbSplBas (hierarchical) and a multilevel class hbSplBasML. 
Further thbSplBas inherits from hbSplBas and thbSplBasML from hbSplBasML
boundCond is a class to save Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions
PoissonSolv is a class to solve a Poisson model problem using multi basis such as hbSplBasML and thbSplBasMl

Poisson
Example file to solve a Poisson problem for different source terms
